testing eqns.py file to test what kind of maths equation to put inbetween each sample loop to give a nice 
linear relationship between number of times to perform loop to number time that takes.

What we found was that there weren't any simple functions we could perform where looping them N times scaled the time taken to do 
that loop linearly.

Instead, fit for math to samplerate.py was used to find a fit relation between how many times to perform a loop of the very simple 1+1 calculation 
to how slow it makes the sample rate
