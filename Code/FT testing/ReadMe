File to numerically create a perfect sine wave function, and functions created of equal or random contributions of perfect sine waves from 
0-20 kHz, so that the Fourier transform code that we use to find the power spectrum of trapped particles can be tested. This is because a weird feauture 
was seen at 10-14 kHz on the power spectrum and we want to investigate if it is due to the code not being properly transform those frequencies 
or if it is due to some phsyical effect.
