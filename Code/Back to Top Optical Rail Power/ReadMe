Code to plot relation between power of trapping laser from a spot of light produced behind the optical rail, compared to the power when a power meter is placed 
directly in the path of the laser as it fires up through the trapping system.

This will enable us to measure the trapping laser power whilst a particle is trapped, as now there is no need to place the power meter in the direct path of the 
trapping beam, which will block out the light from reaching the particle and cause it to fall out of the trap
