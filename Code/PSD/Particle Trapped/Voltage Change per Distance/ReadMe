Now we are taking PSD readings for every particle with an incident power of 0.8 micro watts
We have determined the correct brightness scaling factor for this power
Depending on particle size we will open or close aperture to deliver 0.8W to the PSD


To do feedback control, we need to know what distance change of the C.O.M of the light on 
the PSD corresponds to what change in the signal value

i.e if the particle goes up from the middle by 1mm, by what value do signals 1 and 2 change
Therefore when we get signal changes we can back calculate to figure out what distance change they corresponded to 


For particle w:
We have the micrometer vertical reading to be at 3.49 mm. Which should be the middle of the PSD.
Changing the reading on the micrometer up = moving the PSD down. And vice versa
The spec sheet says PSD resistive length 3.5mm
