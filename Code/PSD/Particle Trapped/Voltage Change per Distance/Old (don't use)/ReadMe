For particle q, found height on  micrometer at which particle was in the middle of the PSD.

Particle in middle of PSD when micrometer reading was 3.59 mm.

We will reduce the micrometer reading by 0.5 mm increments down to 0.09 mm
At each height, we will run read voltages and relabel the batcches according to the height 
on the micrometer at which the batch was taken

From each batch, we can easily take the average of the voltage value on channel 1 and 2 at the height the batch
corresponds to 

Particle q data may need to be retaken. The makeshift black cover may have knocked the aperture
infront of the two focussing lenses, causing some of the scattered light to be blocked.
