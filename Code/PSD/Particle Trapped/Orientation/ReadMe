0-2V square wave from dac. 1/8 Hz (4 seconds at 2V, 4 sec at 0 V)

Movie of particle moving at the same time taken from camera.
When power is high - particle moves left on recording - means particle moves up in real life
When power is low - particle moves right on recording - means particle moves down in real life

Purpose of this is to see does what does a higher and lower voltage on channels 1 and 2 correspond 
to in terms of actual particle motion


Particle p:

When particle went up, channel 1 and 2 voltages went up. 



NOT SURE HOW CORRECT THE ABOVE CONCLUSIONS ARE.

Particle ac     (7 seconds high, seven seconds low, square wave)

The only transition in the batch (batch1) is when the voltage across pockel cell went from +192 to -192. 
This corresponds to laser power going from low to high
Which corresponds to particle moving from a low to high positoin. (Moved from below eqiluilibrium to above equilibrium)
This corresponded to us seeing the voltage across both channels dropping
