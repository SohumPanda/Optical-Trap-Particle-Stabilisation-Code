Open Loop Control System and Closed Loop

OPEN:
Use the signal generator to generate a low frequency square wave whilst particle is trapped
Or use DAC to generate signal

CLOSED:
Use the DAC to generate square wave - based on ADC calculations

Read the particle position on the PSD.
Fourier Transform the data to see if we can recover the frequemcy that we injected in.


Particle n: OPEN LOOP - SIG GEN

Signal: 1.8V peak to peak, square wave, 0.5 Hz


Particle o: OPEN LOOP - DAC

Signal: 2V peak to peak, square wave, 0.5Hz


Particle p: OPEN LOOP - DAC

1. Signal: is 2V peak to peak, sine wave, 250Hz    -  Gauss fit gives 245.8908 +/- std dev 2.35
2. Signal: is 2V peak to peak, sine wave, 55Hz     -  Gauss fit gives 56.1845 +/- std dev 0.63


Particle q: OPEN LOOP - DAC

Signal: 2V peak to peak, sine wave, 52 Hz


Particle w: OPEN LOOP - SIG GEN 
Signal is much better defined when we have a sig gen. So use sig gen
for testing the offset of inputted freqs due to damping of particle in air

1. 2V peak to peak, sine wave, 60Hz
2. 2V peak to peak, sine wave, 70Hz
3. 2V peak to peak, sine wave, 80Hz
4. 2V peak to peak, sine wave, 90Hz
5. 2V peak to peak, sine wave, 100Hz

6. 2V peak to peak, square wave 0.5 Hz


WITH PARTICLE Z MEASURED AND FOUND NEW RELATION FOR BRIGHTNESS SCALING FACTOR




Graphs that end with DAC in the filename indicate the modulating signal come from 
the DAC on the pi. Hence closed loop system
