Instead of finding non linearity of PSD at different brightnesses, we will adjust
the aperture so that for each particle 0.8W of light is incident on the PSD

We can then use the scale factor to make both channels the same value for an incident
power of 0.8W for every particle w do measurements of.

However we will still take the data at differing powers from 0.1W in increments of 0.1 up to 0.8 W
to find the relationship of the scaling factor with power

Take 5 batches 0f 100,000. 
Find the mean value of v1 and v2
Find the scaling factor to multiply channel 2 by for each batch
Take the average scaling factor value over the 5 batches

Done for particle v - 6.6 micron diameter
