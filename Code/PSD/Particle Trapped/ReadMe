For trapped particles, turn off lights and take 10 batch reading.

Each particle folder contains saved batches of data from that particle and plots of the fourier spectrum of that data and the voltage against time 
for that data

Trapped Particles Fourier Transform.py contains the code for calculating the position of the particles from their saved data and being able to fourier transform 
their spectrums. It can produce a voltage against time plot for a given batch of saved data for a particle, a plot of position against time, a comparison of the 
fourier spectrum of the particle to the PSD noise spectrum and a Fourier transform of the position against time graph.

spring constant and corner freq.py can plot the relationship between the corner frequencies of the fourier spectrum of particles against their size.
It can also calculate the trap strength constant (kappa) and plot that against the particle's sizes.
