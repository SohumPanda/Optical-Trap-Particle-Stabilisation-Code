We want to move the PSD along z (forwards and backwards along the direction light is coming into PSD)
and then scan horizontally in x.

At the z of focus, the dot will be smallest on the PSD and the transition when the dot is on the psd to when it is not will bes sharpest
Away from focus the spot will be larger and there will be a gradual transition of signal as we move the spot off the PSD
