For the looped read of calcs or for saving batches, we want to see if the SD we are getting for the N points in a batch
is a good reading that we are comfortable using, or if there is large eror in the measurement of the error.

For N = 100,000 points in a looped read, we computed the SD of 10 batches of N points
