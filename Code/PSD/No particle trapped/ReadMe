1/root N stats dependence folder has code and data for the standard deviation measured of batches of sampled data showing hoe the SD decreases proportionally 
to 1/root(N) as you increase N. Where N is the number of points you are sampling.

Stats of the SD show the distriubtion of the Standard deviations calculated from multiple runs of 100,000 points to see if they vary or are close together.

The other 4 folders have data sampled from the PSD under the conditions of the folder title, and the graphs of the Fourier transforms of the data. 

PSD Light Conditions Fourier Transform.py was used to produce those graphs
