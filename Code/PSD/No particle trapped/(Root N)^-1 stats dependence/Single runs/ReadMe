For Statistics such as the standard devation,
we expect a root N relation.


So the Sd for N points should be proportional to 1/rootN of the amount of points taken

So the SD of 100 points should be 1/root(100)= 1/10 x constant
and th SD for 10,000 should be 1/root(10,000)=1/100 x constant


Data taken for lights on, but PSD blocked by a black object.
Testing the SD relation to N from voltages measured when PSD connected to pi 4 

These values were taken from a single run of N points.


For batches of aprox < 500 points, we are not sampling over long enough times and so the swing in the SD of these batches is large. 
Ranging from 0.05 to 0.002. Over these small timeframes we are probably capturing random glitches in the pi.
