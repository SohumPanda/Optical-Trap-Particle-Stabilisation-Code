For Statistics such as the standard devation,
we expect a root N relation.


So the Sd for N points should be proportional to 1/rootN of the amount of points taken

So the SD of 100 points should be 1/root(100)= 1/10 x constant
and th SD for 10,000 should be 1/root(10,000)=1/100 x constant


Data taken for lights on, but PSD blocked by a black object.
Testing the SD relation to N from voltages measured when PSD connected to pi 4 

Unline single runs, we do a looped run. So for each N points, we will do a looped run
so that 10 consecutive batches of N points are measured and the stats for each batch are given.

We are doing this because it seems like in a looped run the SD of the first batch is alsways higher
and then the following batches SDs are much smaller

For consistency we will take the SDs of 10 looped batches at each number of N points. So we wil set the 
number of batches to 11, and discard the first reading and take the 10 remaining.

We can then take the SDs of each of these 10 batches, and find the mean and SD of the SDs and plot that 
against N to see if we still find the 1/rootN dependence.

We are only doing this because when we will be recording realtime particle data, we won't be collecting data 
in single runs but we will set a looped function to go and collect batches of data of N points.

E.g read N=100,000 points per batch and do 10 consecutive batches. Therefoer atempting to read 1,000,000 consecutive points
saved in 10 batches of 100,000 points each
