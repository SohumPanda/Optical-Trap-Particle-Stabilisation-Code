We saw some weird glitches in the 100,000 batch readings so decided to test out 1,000,000 batch.


9-2-22

On Sohum Pi, reading for 100,000 points had a weird glitch it seemed, where for the first approx 1000 points / 0.1 sec the pi
was recording a higher voltage. We noticed this first occurred for a batch of 1,000,000 and decided to see if 100,000 had the same thing

We swapped the smaple rate down from 10KhZ to something lower (5.6kHz) and it looked like it had fixed it

We then took a batch2 of 100,000 samples at 10KHz and there was no glitch.

But when we switched back to 1,000,000 samples the glitch appeared again and then also reappeared on a third batch of 100,000 (not saved or plotted but it did)
