From the bitscope testing, it looks like we couldn't recreate the glitch high intial for 100,000 points. Kai tested
at least 10 times on his Pi and we have also never seen it before.

--> This suggests the issue is either with Sohum Pi, or there is no problem with the Pi and Code and the spike is caused 
by some physical effect of the PSD when we are in the lab

--> On Kai's Pi we are still seeing an initial voltage spike. This suggests the problem is not with the Pi as both Pi's do 
the same thing

--> The problem is likely ont with the code as there is on intial voltage spike when we are recording voltages generated by
the bitscope

--> probably to do with the PSD talking to the Pi, could be the power supply to the PSD slowly changing current. Or when the 
PSD interfaces with the Pi there is a small increase in voltage to intialise the channel for reading data, leading to the small
voltage spike (which would otherwise be interpreted as the light intensity being lower for the first 0.1 ish seconds for some reason)
