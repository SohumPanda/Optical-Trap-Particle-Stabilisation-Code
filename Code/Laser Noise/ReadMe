Data taken directly from Oscilloscope of the AC components of the laser power at a range of laser powers. TN refers to a 'toaster number' which is the 
number that was displayed on the dial to increase the power of the laser. 

Code used to fourier transform the AC component of the laser noise to compare the amplitude of the significant frequencies at different laser powers
