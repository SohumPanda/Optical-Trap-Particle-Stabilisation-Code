read voltages.py is the main file. 
It contains the functions to be able to read the data from a single or both channels at the maximum possible sample rate.
To read the voltages from a single or both channels with the capability of adjusting the sample rate
The feedback function that can read voltages, and adjust the pockel cell voltage through te DAC
Loop functions to be able to take multiple batches of N=100,000 V and save them

As well it contains code to be able to alter the pockel cell voltage through the DAC with either 
a square wave or an adjustable frequency sine wave

To send a sine or square wave from the DAC and sample the signal recieved from a trapped particle that 
is responding to that signal, threading is needed to both continuously sample and send a signal making 
use of both the DAC and ADC

calcs.py is a useful file for helping to align the PSD to the centre of the Particle
It contains code that doesnt save any data but can give you the voltage reading in real time
It can also give you the mean and standard deviation of N points and loop that continuously

moving av.py constains the code to be able to calculate the moving average of N points

fitting moving ave.py extends on te code in moving av.py by adding the ability to fit the 
N most recent points to find out if the gradient is positive or negative, and send the appropriate 
output voltage from the DAC to counteract the particle motion

feedback function.py combines the function that can read both voltages simultaneously (readvbothsr) with the 
function in fitting moving ave.py to create a overall feedback function called feedback() that can 
sample from both channels, save the data and also calculate the particle motion and send a DAC voltage to counteract 
it.

position.py contains the code to convert the voltages from channel 1 and channel 2 into the actual position 
of the particle, taking into account the magnification of the imaging system.

saved data plotting.py contains a file to quickly plot the voltage against time for any batch of saved data 
if we want to confirm or double check readings by looking at them graphically
