Testing what is the maximum clock speed to run the ADC chip that can still allow for smooth sampling of data from both channels. 

bus speed fitting.py contains a sine fit to test how well sampled data of sine waves generated from a Bitscope lie along the best fit sine curve for different ADC clock frequencies
