For an ADC bus speed of 'a' MHz, readv1() samples on average at 'b' kHz
It seems like you need to run readv1() 4 to 5 times before each run gives conistently the same sample rate
Wait 10-5 seconds after running file to let, wait for assistant to finish 'analyzing code', and then sample rate 
becomes more consitant between each run of readv()
